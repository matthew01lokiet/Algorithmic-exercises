<h1 align="center">The Love-Letter Mystery</h1>

## Description:
James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

To do this, he follows two rules:

    He can only reduce the value of a letter by 1, i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
    The letter a may not be reduced any further.

Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.

## Examples:

Sample Input

```
4
abc
abcba
abcd
cba
```

Sample Output

```
2
0
4
2
```
