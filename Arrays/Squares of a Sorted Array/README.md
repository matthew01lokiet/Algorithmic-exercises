<h1 align="center">Squares of a Sorted Array</h1>

## Description:
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Examples:

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
