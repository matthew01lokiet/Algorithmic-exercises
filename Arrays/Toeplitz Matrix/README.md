<h1 align="center">Toeplitz Matrix</h1>

## Description:
Given an m x n matrix, return true if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return false.

A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

## Examples:

Example 1:

```
	Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
	Output: true
	Explanation:
	In the above grid, the diagonals are:
	"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
	In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
```

Example 2:

```
	Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
	Output: false
	Explanation:
	The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```
