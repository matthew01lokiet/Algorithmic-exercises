<h1 align="center">Sort Array By Parity II</h1>

## Description:
Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

## Examples:

Example 1:

```
	Input: [4,2,5,7]
	Output: [4,5,2,7]
	Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
